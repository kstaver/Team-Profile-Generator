## Description
This application is useful for keeping track of the members of your team at work. The Team Profile Generator is easy to use and outputs a simple site that stores your entered data. This app allows for multiple engineers and interns to be added to your team. However, only one manager can be added. Please take a look at the usage section for an example of a team profile that I created.
